Portfolio site / project lookup / document hub for stuff I've done! The site itself is prepretually a work in progress, but the master branch representes (at least at this point) versions I'm happy to put out there! Other branches may be a bit more of a mess depending on when you check them.

Resources and whatnot:
- I used fontawesome for icons and whatnot! A link to fontawesome's icon license is here: https://fontawesome.com/license
- For some formatting and whatnot, I made use of bootstrap, which you can find here: https://getbootstrap.com
- There's some fun sorting that goes on in places, and that's thanks to MixItUp: https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/
