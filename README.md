Portfolio site / project lookup / document hub for stuff I've done! The site itself is prepretually a work in progress, but that's alright - isn't everything?

Resources and whatnot:
- I used fontawesome for icons and such! A link to fontawesome's icon license is here: https://fontawesome.com/license
- For formatting and responsive behavior, I made use of Bootstrap, which you can find here: https://getbootstrap.com
- There's some fun sorting that goes on in places, and that's thanks to MixItUp: https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/
